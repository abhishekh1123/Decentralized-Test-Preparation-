# **Decentralized Test Preparation DApp**

## **Vision**
The Decentralized Test Preparation DApp aims to revolutionize the way students engage in their studies by incentivizing them with cryptocurrency tokens. By integrating blockchain technology, we create a transparent, secure, and decentralized platform where students can earn tokens for their academic achievements. These tokens can be redeemed for various rewards, fostering a competitive yet collaborative learning environment.
